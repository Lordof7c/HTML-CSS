            <p>The Sega Saturn is a 32-bit home video game console developed by Sega. Released in 1994 in Japan, and 1995 in North America and Europe, the Saturn is the successor to the Sega Genesis, and Sega's fourth game console. It has dual-CPU architecture and eight processors, and was designed around a CPU developed by electronics company Hitachi. Its games are in CD-ROM format. The system was initially successful in Japan, but failed to sell large numbers in the United States after a surprise launch four months before its scheduled release, and an aggressive price war against Sony's PlayStation. Following the release of the Nintendo 64 in late 1996, the Saturn rapidly lost market share in the U.S., and was discontinued in 1998 in the country. The console is considered a commercial failure, selling just over 9 million units worldwide, blamed in part due to Sega's failure to release a Sonic the Hedgehog video game, known in development as Sonic X-treme, for the system.The Sega Saturn is a 32-bit home video game console developed by Sega.

            <P>There are 163 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) in Norfolk, out of which 123 are biological, 25 are geological and 15 are both biological and geological. In England, SSSIs are designated by Natural England, which is responsible for protecting England's natural environment. Designation as an SSSI gives legal protection to the most important wildlife and geological sites.</P>

            <h4>Anatomy</h4>
            <h1>Plant cell</h1>
            <p>Plant cells are eukaryotic cells present in green plants, photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. Their distinctive features include primary cell walls containing cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectin, the presence of plastids with the capability to perform photosynthesis and store starch, a large vacuole that regulates turgor pressure, the absence of flagella or centrioles, except in the gametes, and a unique method of cell division involving the formation of a cell plate or phragmoplast that separates the new daughter cells.</p>
            <h1>Aerenchyma</h1>
            <p>Aerenchyma is a spongy tissue that forms spaces or air channels in the leaves, stems and roots of some plants, which allows exchange of gases between the shoot and the root.[1] The channels of air-filled cavities (see image to right) provide a low-resistance internal pathway for the exchange of gases such as oxygen and ethylene between the plant above the water and the submerged tissues. Aerenchyma is also widespread in aquatic and wetland plants which must grow in hypoxic soils.</p>
            <h1>Xylem</h1>
            <p>Xylem is one of the two types of transport tissue in vascular plants, phloem being the other. The basic function of xylem is to transport water from roots to stems and leaves, but it also transports nutrients.[1][2] The word "xylem" is derived from the Greek word ξύλον (xylon), meaning "wood"; the best-known xylem tissue is wood, though it is found throughout a plant.[3] The term was introduced by Carl Nägeli in 1858</p>

            <h4>History of Human Anatomy</h4>
            <h1>Greek period:</h1>
            <p>Greek period in the history of human anatomy started somewhere near 400 BC. The most famous anatomists of this period were Hippocrates and Herophilus. Hippocrates was regarded as the father of medicine and he was one of the founders of anatomy.</p>
            <h1>Roman period:</h1>
            <p>The most prominent anatomist of this period was Galen. He is known as the “Prince of Physicians” because he was the first experimental physiologist. His teachings were followed for nearly 15 centuries considering them as infallible authorities of anatomy.</p>
            <h1>Fourteenth century:</h1>
            <p>The most prominent scientist of this period was Mondino de Liuzzi. He was an Italian and had the post of professor of anatomy in Balogna. His famous book “Anthomia” was treated as the authorized anatomical text for over a century.</p>
